        How is Catmoon (CATMOON) different from other meme coins?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-base px-2">
        <b>Catmoon.io</b> is a project revolving around a digital asset that
        mimics the characteristics of cats and will be used as an asset
        within its own ecosystem. So what makes Catmoon unique compared to
        other cat meme coins? Community-owned: Unlike other meme coins,
        Catmoon is completely community-run, meaning your voice matters to
        the project developers! They encourage investors/promoters to
        actively participate in the future activities of the project. More
        than a cryptocurrency: Catmoons vision goes beyond providing an
        alternative form of currency. The project developers wish to build
        an ecosystem around Catmoon, where it is used as the main payment
        method in their own market. Here, users can easily buy goods with
        Catmoon. This market offers not only cat-related products but also
        popular items, showing <br /> the great ambition of the project{" "}
        <br /> <b>Utility</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As the true community coin , $CATMOON utility comes in the form of
        its strong community and thriving ecosystem of integrations :

        <b>CATMOON NFTs:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Catmoon NFT is an NFT collection of 1000 pieces of pixelated cat art
        minted on the NFTs platform. The collection was built by cat-loving
        artists with the hope of creating fun and cute moments. This is also
        the key for users to participate in games with similar pixel

      <p>
        Decentralized governance (DAO): Another difference of Catmoon is the
        decentralized governance model (DAO). This means that the project
        operates without the intervention of any third party (such as the
        dev team,Whale...). The decision-making power belongs to the
        community, investors/promoters, so everyone 
        <br />
        has an equal voice. In
        <br />
        short, Catmoon is more than just a meme coin about cats. The project
        aims to build a decentralized ecosystem, empowering the community
        and bringing more convenience to users.
