            coin is inspired b y a cute cat and is supported by the cat-loving
            community. <br />
            Catmoon is a cat theme token that focuses on community
            decentralization and adop tion. $CATMOON is designed to make
            memeCoins great again. $CATMOON is for the people, always. Fueled by
            pure meme power, $CATMOON will lead the way. Catmoon is a
            deflationary cryptocurrency, meaning the total money supply will
            decrease over time. This helps Catmoon have a lower inflation rate
            than other <br /> cryptocurrencies.{" "}
